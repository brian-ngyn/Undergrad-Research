# Undergrad-Research 

This repository holds the code written between May 2022 - August 2022, as part of my undergraduate research.

My research was funded by the [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) and supervised by [Dr. Geoffrey Messier](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/contacts/geoffrey-messier) at the Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary.

If you have the time, please take a quick read-through of the paper I co-authored [here](https://github.com/brian-ngyn/Undergrad-Research/blob/main/BME_Abstract.pdf), alongside the graduate students I worked with and my two supervisors. This paper was submitted to the [Annual Alberta Biomedical Engineering Conference](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/biomedical/news-events/annual-alberta-biomedical-engineering-conference).
